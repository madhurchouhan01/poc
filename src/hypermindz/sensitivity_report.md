## Sensitivity Analysis Report  

**Parameter Analyzed:** "Flight (months)"  
We analyzed the impact of varying "Flight (months)" from 7 to 13. Hereâ€™s what we observed:

  - As the flight duration increased, **Gross Unique Reach** peaked at 392.29 million when the flight is extended to 7 months but gradually decreased to 211.23 million at 13 months.  

  - **Target Unique Reach** also showed a corresponding decline, reaching a high of 47.07 million at 7 months and dropping to 25.35 million at 13 months.  

  - The **Gross Reach %** started at 152.05% at 7 months, indicating strong effectiveness, but diminished down to 81.87% at 13 months.  
  
  - Likewise, the **Target Reach %** showed high values at shorter flights, maxing out at 2353.53% at 7 months, but decreasing to 1267.29% at 13 months.  
**Recommendation:** A flight duration of 7 months optimizes reach metrics while maximizing budget efficiency.
